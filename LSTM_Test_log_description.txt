Introduction:

This project is part of my time series prediction SELF LEARNING Tool.
Material is based on Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program medium.com blogs
and https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/ documentation


1. LSTM in Keras for Inter stock price prediction
Files:
intel_shares.csv in data folder - historical stock price data for Intel Inc from Quandl. Alredy in clean format.


Folder: model
model_LSTM.pkl - trained LSTM model in pickle file.
scaler_LSTM.gz - data scaler object saved in archive file (for use in LSTM_predict.py)


Run the following command in the project's root directory to load historial stock price data and output a trained LSTM model and data scaler object file.
python train.py < historical stock price in CSV filepath > < output model filepath in .pkl > < output data scaler object filepath in .gz > < test size ratio > < training time frame (days) > < offset for training data; if unsure, use training time frame >

LSTM_train.py  for training a model
python LSTM_train.py data/intel_shares.csv model/model_LSTM.pkl model/scaler_LSTM.gz 0.2 60 60


Run the following command in the project's root directory to load model pickle file, data scaler object file and historical stock price. The predicted price will be shown.
python predictor.py < model filepath > < data scaler object filepath > < historical stock price in CSV filepath >


python LSTM_predict.py model/model_LSTM.pkl model/scaler_LSTM.gz data/intel_shares.csv
